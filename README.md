<h1>Student Management System Python</h1>
A lightweight command-line interface (CLI) tool for managing student data. Built with a focus on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and persistent file storage. Add, Update, View, Search, and Delete student records. Persistent data storage using MySQL. Search functionality by Student ID.
Developer: Mariam Safdar & Ayesha Mehtab

<h2>Features:</h2>
<p>Student Data Management (CRUD operations):The primary function is to manage student records efficiently. This includes:</p>
<h4>Adding new students:</h4> <p> Entering details such as name, age, ID, course and email into the MySQL database.</p>
<h4>Viewing student details:</h4> <p>Displaying records of all students or a specific student via the command line.</p>
<h4>Updating student information:</h4> <p>Modifying existing records (e.g., updating phone numbers, grades, or personal details).</p>
<h4>Deleting student records:</h4> <p>Removing student entries from the database, typically using a unique identifier like a student ID or roll number.</p>
<h4>Search and Filter Functionality:</h4> <p>Users can search for specific student records using criteria such as ID, name, or roll number to quickly retrieve information.</p>
<h4>Database Connectivity:</h4> <p>The system uses a Python library (like mysql-connector-python or pymysql) to establish a connection with the MySQL database, ensuring data integrity and secure storage.</p>
<h4>Command Line Interface (CLI):</h4> <p>The system provides a simple, menu-driven command-line interface, allowing users to interact by selecting options. </p>
Benefits of this Approach
Simplicity: The CLI keeps the application lightweight and focused solely on core logic and database interaction, without needing a complex graphical user interface (GUI).
Portability: The application can run on various operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) as long as Python and MySQL are installed.
Efficiency: It is effective for environments where manual record-keeping is replaced by an automated, digital system, reducing manual errors and improving data accessibility. 
Overall, this type of system is a foundational tool for automating administrative tasks in an educational setting.
